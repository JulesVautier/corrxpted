            I can't stop thinking about this game. I know that I saw this video. I need to find it, whatever the time it
            will take. I decided to look over my whole Youtube history. Three years of watching about twenty videos
            every days.
        </p>
        <p>I checked everything.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center">It took me hours.</p>
        <p style="text-align: right">But I succeeded !</p>
        <p>I finally found the
            <a class="strange" href="https://youtu.be/ZVfU23vbrjI" target="_blank"> video</a>, and the
            <a class="strange censored" href="https://aetherinteractive.itch.io/forgotten" target="_blank">corrxpted
                game</a>.
            <br>
            I also found one the
            <a class="shiny" href="https://wonderbreath.neocities.org/" target="_blank">creator website</a>.
            <span>Clear. </span><span>Design. </span><span>Simple. </span><span class="censored">Intriguing. </span>
            <br> Of course, I checked
            <a class="shiny" style="color: orange" href="https://neocities.org/" target="_blank">neocities.org</a>.
            An amazing world of

            Three years ago I was watching a
            <a class="strange" href="https://youtu.be/ZVfU23vbrjI" target="_blank"> strange video</a>
            about a
            <a class="strange censored" href="https://aetherinteractive.itch.io/forgotten" target="_blank">forgotten
                game</a>.
            I was so fascinated by the concept behind this game that I became obsessed. But, for an unknown reason... I
            never tried to play it nor did researches about it. I just continued to think almost daily about this
            corrupted game just using my imagination. Maybe I was afraid to discover that this game wasn't as
            fascinating as I expected, maybe I wanted to protect myself from a <span class="censored">heart breaking deception</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Three years pass. I'm still thinking about this game but... I forgot its name... My own memory is <span
                class="censored">corrupted</span>.
            I barely remember anything but a concept and a <span style="color: #a500ff">purple</span> color.
        </p>
        <p>
            I decide that it's time to finally play this game. I have to know.
            <br> The video is gone. I start looking for 'corrupted game' on google, youtube, everywhere: nothing.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Did this game even existed ? Maybe I just dreamed it...
